# Sprint 1 Hackathon

It's time for the first Hackathon - 8 hours of independent data crunching and analysis! It's a chance to put everything you've learnt over the past sprint into practice, experience the realities of data science, and test out new ideas in a experimental environment.  

### Task

You will be provided with several datasets from different sources that cover a range of topics. Some data might be specific to your cohort/company, while other data will be completely unfamiliar. You are also welcome to bring your own data that you would like to analyse if your organisation's data sharing rules permit that.

In the time provided, create a data product using some of the skills you have learnt/practised over the sprint. You are free to choose the dataset, aspect, and methods that most interest you; you can even combine multiple datasets if you wish.

### Guidelines

* It's a good idea to explore the data available early on; having a strong understanding of a dataset's structure and contents will be invaluable for modelling
* All the datasets will need some level of data cleaning before modelling can begin. Some will be much cleaner than others
* It's best to work in pairs/small groups
* A hackathon isn't about creating a finished, polished product; it's about learning, exploring, and collaborating together

### Datasets
We have carefully chosen datasets that allow you to practice the skills covered in Sprint 1. While the data used in the hackathons might not always be directly relevant to your day-to-day work, the skills, experience, and ideas you garner from working with them will have wider applications.
