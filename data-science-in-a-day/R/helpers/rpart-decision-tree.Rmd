# 1. Training a decision tree model using Rpart
```
tree <-  rpart(Loan_Status ~ .,
              method = "class",
              data = train)
```

# 2. Plotting your model using rpart.plot
```
rpart.plot(tree, type=5, extra=2)
```

# 3. Making predictions on test dataset
```
Predict_tree <-  predict(object=tree,
                        newdata= test,
                        type="class")
```

# 4. Output confusion matrix to assess how well our model has done
```
confusionMatrix(data=Predict_tree, reference= test$Loan_Status)
```
