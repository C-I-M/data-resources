    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Plotly Express**](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/) for making interactive, publication-quality graphics \n",
    "    * Has more graphing options not typically found in other packages \n",
    "    * Can make your visuals [interactive and animated](https://plot.ly/python/animations/)\n",
    "    * *Optional*: Plotly Dash to make dashboards for your plotly graphics\n",

    "These other packages that could be useful. Take a look at them or use in on the online practice!\n",
