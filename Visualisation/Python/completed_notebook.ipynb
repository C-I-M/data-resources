    "# Data Visualisation Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we will practice data visualisation in Python using Kaggle survey data, asking people about their use of various machine learning tools in the workplace [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018). A great resource for general tips about making visualisations, [Google](https://material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html) has their own in-house resource with lots of useful information. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be focusing on the following two packages: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) for making easy, visually appealing graphics \n",
    "    * Better default graphics, and a larger variety of graphs to enhance data communication \n",
    "    * More customiseable and visually appealing (e.g., [colour palettes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html) & [figure aesthetics](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    * *Optional*: Plotly Dash to make dashboards for your plotly graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional:* These other packages that could be additional, beneficial tools. Take a look at them or use in on the online practice!\n",
    "3. [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html), another package for making interactive plots\n",
    "4. [**ggplot**](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot) (a graphics package from R, made useable in Python)\n",

    "Throughout this practice, keep in mind which graphs work best with certain types of data (see the below list). \n",

    "# Plotly Express\n",
    "[Plotly express](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/) is another package that can take your visualisations to a whole other level. Aside from the same functionalities as seaborn, it has additional graphs, and the ability to make your graphs [animated](https://plot.ly/python/animations/) that you can save offline as html files. \n",

    "### Graphs in Plotly Express\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these graphs work in a similar way to seaborn (more information [here](https://plot.ly/python-api-reference/plotly.express.html)). As a side note, to use a categorical variable as a \"grouping\" variable, you use `color=` (instead of `hue=` like in seaborn).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making graphs interactive and animated\n",
    "You can show more information when hovering over a data point by using the `hover_name=\"__\"` parameter. Simply type a categorical variable in the `\"\"`, and the information will appear when you hover over a specific data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main animation parameters you can add to your graphs:\n",
    "* Use `animation_frame=\"__\"` to move between \"frames\" (e.g., each frame might be a different year to show how the graph changes over time)\n",
    "* Use `animation_group=\"__\"` to group the data points by that change in each frame\n",
    "\n",
    "Animations can be very powerful, but only in the right circumstances. This usually means it is only helpful (and should be used) when you are dealing with data that has some aspect of time to it."
